# **MNIST CNN**
[Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/about/) is the first deep learning library to provide a single consistent interface to all the most commonly used deep learning applications for vision, text, tabular data, time series, and collaborative filtering.

Here, I have used [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/about/) API to perform **Digit Classification** on **MNIST Dataset**. [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai/about/) is built on top of **PyTorch**.
